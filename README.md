# Unity-Reuseable-Selection-Menu

Goal of this project is to build a universal Menu system that I can reuse on different projects

Add the options in order into the menu list.

Menu name will find another menu on the same Scene and display it and hide current one
2nd option GoToSceneFileName will navigate to another scene
3rd option will run a custom script (close application for example)

There is some serious jank everywhere but overall it will allow me to not worry much about menus in the future. I need to add some global settings like screen size and such


When in doubt, use the prefabs
